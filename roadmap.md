# Cloudy Future Roadmap ☁️

This is a living document for all the things we want to polish or add later that aren't critical for the current vibe.

## Tech & Security
*   **Persistent Storage**: Right now, selections reset on reload. We'll need to plug in a local database or cloud sync so user data actually stays safe.
*   **Security Lock**: Add a toggle for FaceID or a passcode. Since this is a personal journal, it needs to feel like a locked diary.
*   **Haptic Engine**: Wire up the "Haptic Feedback" toggle to actual device vibrations. It'll make buttons and swipe headers feel much more tactile.
*   **Dynamic Versioning**: Automate the version number display in the profile so it matches the real build.

## Experience & Polish
*   **Custom Mascots**: The user wants to design their own companions eventually. We'll need a way to upload or select from a wider gallery.
*   **Smarter Reminders**: Instead of just fixed times, maybe "Smart Reminders" that nudge you if you haven't written by the time you usually do.
*   **Export as PDF**: The button is there, but it doesn't do anything yet. Need to implement a generator that turns journal entries into a pretty, printable layout.
*   **Dark Mode**: The warm cream is great, but a late-night "Midnight" theme would be a nice option for journaling in bed.

## Journaling Features
*   **Multi-Question Prompts**: Sometimes one gratitude isn't enough. Allow users to cycle through a few different prompts.
*   **Photo Attachments**: Letting people snap a photo of their "small win" of the day to go with the text.
*   **Weekly Highlights**: A special view in the history that picks the most "liked" or significant memories.
